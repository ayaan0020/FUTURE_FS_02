## 🔍 About the Project

**LeadFlow Mini CRM** is a lightweight, high-performance Client Lead Management System designed for agencies, freelancers, and startups. 

Whenever a prospect fills out a contact form on a client website, business owners need a reliable workflow to:
1. **Capture & Store** website leads automatically in a central database.
2. **Track Pipeline Status** (`New` → `Contacted` → `In Progress` → `Converted` → `Lost`).
3. **Log Follow-up Interactions** (Calls, Emails, Meetings, and Timestamped Notes).
4. **Analyze Sales Metrics** (Conversion Ratios, Won Revenue, Acquisition Channels).

This application solves these exact business challenges with a sleek, responsive React dashboard backed by a Node.js/Express REST API.
